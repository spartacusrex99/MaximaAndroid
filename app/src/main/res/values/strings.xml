        Maxima is an information layer running on top of the Minima peer to peer network\n
        \n
        All messages are signed and then encrypted so only the individual you send the message to can decrypt it and only they know that you sent it\n
        \n
        Your Minima P2P network connections constantly change and you create a new and unique random address on every node you are connected to\n
        \n
        By updating your contacts as to your current location whenever your address changes they can always find you - and vice versa\n
        \n
        What is interesting, original and extremely powerful is that Maxima requires 2-way consent\n
        \n
        You create a connection with a User and once that connection is established both of you can message the other\n
        \n
        Should either party wish to terminate the connection they can do that and then neither party can message the other - as they do not know where to get hold of you\n
        \n
        In effect this means if I delete someone from my contact list I am also deleted from their list\n
        \n
        Maxima messages are currently paid for with a small amount of PoW. Work. You \'mine\' your message. The rationale is that a User will forward your message if you do some work protecting their coins. In so doing you are also protecting your coins. Win Win..\n
        \n
        In future you will be able to pay for message delivery in Minima over the Omnia L2 network\n
        \n
        This is an early BETA at the moment but I hope you enjoy using it\n
