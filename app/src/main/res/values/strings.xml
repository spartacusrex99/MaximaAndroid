        Maxima is an information transport layer running on top of the Minima peer to peer network.\n
        \n
        All messages are signed and then encrypted so only the individual you send the message to can decrypt it and only they know that you sent it.\n
        \n
        Your Minima P2P network connections are dynamic and constantly change. You create a new unique public key for every node you connect to.\n
        \n
        By updating your contacts as to your current location whenever your address changes they can always find you - and vice versa.\n
        \n
        What is interesting, original and extremely powerful is that Maxima requires 2-way consent.\n
        \n
        You create a connection with a User and once that connection is established both of you can message the other.\n
        \n
        Should either party wish to terminate the connection they can do that and then neither party can message the other - as they do not know who or where the other party is.\n
        \n
        In effect this means if I delete someone from my contact list, I am also deleted from their list.\n
        \n
        Maxima messages are currently paid for with a small amount of PoW. Work. You \'mine\' your message. The rationale is that a User will forward your message if you do some work protecting their coins. In so doing you are also protecting your coins. Win Win..\n
        \n
        In future you will be able to pay for message delivery in Minima itself over the Omnia Layer 2 network. This will decrease delay and increase throughput.\n
        \n
        You have to pay something - as this prevents spam and makes Maxima incentive compatible. There will always be Users prepared to forward your messages..\n
        \n
        This is still an early BETA version but I hope you enjoy using it.\n
